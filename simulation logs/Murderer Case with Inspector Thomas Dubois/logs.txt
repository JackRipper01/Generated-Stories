Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:

Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:

Eleanor Finch's turn in Drawing Room:

Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Eleanor Finch, ""Miss Finch," I say, my voice laced with a touch of sympathetic curiosity, "You mentioned being with Lord Alistair in the library. Did you happen to notice anything… unusual, before you parted ways? Any indication that… something was amiss?" I pause, allowing my eyes to flit over her briefly, before adding with a subtle emphasis, "Or any… specific items that may have captured your attention?""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Thomas Dubois, ""I fix Thomas Dubois with a steady gaze. \"The precise details, Mr. Dubois, are best left to the authorities. Suffice to say, Lord Alistair was discovered in the Study.

Director:
 'Small Bottle' (described as: A small, empty bottle, possibly containing oil, found near the overturned armchair., state: empty) appears in Study.


Eleanor Finch's turn in Drawing Room:

Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Eleanor Finch, ""Miss Finch," I say, my voice calm but firm, "You were with Lord Alistair shortly before his death, in the library, you say. And you noticed nothing… amiss.

Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:

Director:
 'Blood Stain' (described as: A small, but spreading, blood stain on the carpet near the overturned armchair, almost entirely concealed by the shadow., state: spreading) appears in Study.


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois, such thorough questioning is, of course, expected. But perhaps, before we delve too deeply into Miss Finch's affairs, we might consider the *more immediate* implications of… the oil? It seems a rather significant detail, wouldn't you agree? Might it be connected to the… incident in the Study? Perhaps, Mr. Davies, you could enlighten us? Is there anything... valuable that might""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Xenia Petrova, ""Madame Petrova, the source of the oil is, as yet, undetermined. It appears to be a… mechanical issue. As for its connection to Lord Alistair's… demise, that, too, is under investigation. I am not at liberty to speculate.""

Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Mr. Davies, ""Flammable," I murmur, my voice low and carrying just enough to be overheard, "That would be… *unfortunate*. Such a dreadful thing, a fire. Destroys everything. And, of course," I add, my voice taking on a more theatrical tone, "it would be a terrible shame if any of the… more *irreplaceable* pieces were to be… damaged.""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Eleanor Finch, ""Miss Finch, perhaps the smell of oil is causing some… uneasiness. If you are feeling unwell, I would be more than happy to… examine you. It would be a shame if any of us were to succumb to the stresses of the day. Such a thing might complicate… matters further.""


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Davies," I say, my voice steady and low, "You seem particularly concerned about the authorities' investigation. Is there something specific you believe they might overlook? Perhaps something… hidden?""


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois, I find your line of questioning… *fascinating*. And perhaps, a little… *premature*. Before we concern ourselves with the mysteries of the oil, wouldn't you agree that we should first establish the identity of those who were *closest* to Lord Alistair in his final hours? Those, for example, who were involved in… *financial discussions*?""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois," I say, my voice calm but with a subtle undercurrent of steel, "While Madame Petrova's suggestion is… prudent, I believe we should remain focused on the immediate concerns. Your interest in Miss Finch's affairs, while perhaps well-intentioned, feels a touch… precipitous. Before we cast stones, perhaps we should consider the *practical* implications of this oil. Mr. Davies, could you confirm if there are any flammable materials stored near the Study door? A fire, as Madame Petrova so aptly""


Director:
 'Kitchen Knife' (described as: A very sharp kitchen knife, similar to those in the knife rack, now bloodied and lying near the entrance to the hidden passage., state: bloodied) appears in Study.


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:

The oil, the circumstances in the Study, and the… *compromised* state of whatever container it originated from. These are the physical clues, the tangible starting points. If we dismiss them too readily, we risk overlooking""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois, as I have stated, the investigation is best left to the authorities. I am not at liberty to discuss the specifics of the situation in the Study, or the state of the container, whatever it may have been. Your persistence is... unproductive.""

And, *perhaps*, a rather significant distraction. But I must confess, my mind keeps returning to one particular detail of my conversation with Lord Alistair. We were, of course, discussing… acquisitions. And one item in particular, that might have potentially changed hands had he been… more fortunate. Perhaps, Mr. Davies, *if* the authorities have already surveyed the Study, you could shed some light on""

Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Aris Thorne, ""The tray," I say, my voice flat and devoid of emotion, "was used to carry refreshments. It was found near the Study door. It appears to have... *fallen*." I allow a moment of silence to hang in the air, before adding, "The circumstances surrounding its presence are, as always, under investigation.""


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Aris Thorne, ""Mr. Thorne," I say, my voice calm but carrying the weight of scrutiny, "if you would be so kind as to place that tray back on the table, undisturbed. Before it is potentially examined by the authorities. I believe it would be prudent to preserve the evidence.""


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Aris Thorne, ""Mr. Thorne, how... *curious*. To find the tray fallen near the Study. And, even more intriguing, to find *oil* present. Perhaps, the authorities would appreciate you keeping a careful eye on it before… before they take it away.”"


Eleanor Finch's turn in Guest Bedroom:
 Eleanor Finch glances around the room, reaches for the window latch, and subtly tests the weight of the suitcase. Because Eleanor Finch is trying to appear casual while assessing the situation and the suitcase.


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Xenia Petrova, ""I slowly lower the silver tray, feigning a thoughtful expression. "Mr. Dubois, of course. Preservation of evidence is paramount. I wouldn't want to… impede the investigation. However," I say, directing my gaze towards Xenia Petrova, "I must confess, Madame Petrova, I find your… *fascination* with this tray rather interesting. Perhaps you could enlighten us as to why you find it so… *intriguing*? Did you, perhaps, see it earlier? Or, perhaps, its current proximity to the Study sparks certain… associations?" I then place the tray back onto the table, carefully""


Eleanor Finch's turn in Guest Bedroom:
 Eleanor Finch quickly moves to the dressing table, picks up the mirror, and scans the room, her eyes darting around nervously. Because Eleanor Finch is looking for anything suspicious in the room.


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Davies, you seem particularly anxious about the authorities' investigation, and the details surrounding the Study. Perhaps you could alleviate some of that anxiety by simply answering a few questions. For example, what type of oil is present, and what was its original container? A simple answer, if you have one, would be most helpful.""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Thomas Dubois, ""The specifics of the oil and its container are matters for the investigation. Your continued questioning, Mr. Dubois, is becoming tiresome. I have nothing further to add on the matter.""


Director:
 'Bloodied Handprint' (described as: A faint handprint, smeared with blood, visible on the doorframe leading from the Study to the Drawing Room., state: faint) appears in Drawing Room.


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne  : "“Miss Finch,” I say, my voice low and soothing, “The… *unpleasantness* in the Study seems to be causing a degree of unease. Are you quite alright? The stress of the situation could potentially exacerbate any… sensitivities. Perhaps a brief rest in your chambers would be beneficial. I would, of course, be available to… attend to you.” I pause, allowing my gaze to linger on her face before adding, “Should you require it, a calming draught might be… *necessary*.”"


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Aris Thorne, ""Oh, the *irony*! To be gathered here, discussing shadows and oil, when the true tragedy lies in the *untold story*! Lord Alistair, gone before the ink could dry on the agreement! And, I daresay, before I could even *admire* the masterpiece he had promised me... the 'Shadow of the""

 Thomas Dubois circles the silver tray, touches its edge with a gloved finger, and sniffs, his face carefully neutral. Because Thomas Dubois is examining the silver tray for clues related to the oil and the recent events.


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova  : ""The *Shadow of the Raven*," I whisper, my voice barely audible, yet calculated to carry across the room. "A painting, they say, of such exquisite darkness… a true masterpiece. And, alas, now… *unattainable*.""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Xenia Petrova, ""Madame Petrova, the 'Shadow of the Raven'? An ambitious commission indeed. One that, I understand, required a rather… *significant* initial investment. And, if I may be so bold, perhaps a rather… *unwise* one, given Lord Alistair’s current… predicament. A painting is a tangible item, Madame. Far easier to… *dispose of* than, say, a considerable sum of money already spent.”"


Eleanor Finch's turn in Guest Bedroom:
 Eleanor Finch opens the wardrobe, hides the suitcase among her belongings, and closes the wardrobe again. Because Eleanor Finch wants to hide the suitcase without being observed.


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Aris Thorne, ""Mr. Thorne, your pronouncements regarding Lord Alistair's affairs are… *impertinent*. The financial arrangements, or lack thereof, surrounding a painting are hardly the focus of the current, far more pressing, situation. I suggest you confine your inquiries to the matters at hand.""


Eleanor Finch's turn in Drawing Room:
 Eleanor Finch closes the wardrobe, leans against it, takes a breath, and walks towards the Drawing Room door, maintaining a slow pace. Because Eleanor Finch wants to leave the Guest Bedroom and appear calm.


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Aris Thorne, ""Mr. Thorne, your concerns about the 'initial investment' are... *intriguing*. Perhaps you have some insight into the details of my agreement with the late Lord Alistair? Did *you* know the precise sum, the terms, the specifics of this... *untimely* acquisition?""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies turns towards the grandfather clock, feigning interest and checks his watch with exaggerated care. Because Mr. Davies wants to avoid direct eye contact with the other occupants while subtly observing the surroundings and possibly the reactions of others.


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Davies, your reluctance to discuss the oil is… *understandable*. However, a simple denial would suffice. Silence, in this circumstance, is far more revealing. Are you perhaps... protecting something? Or someone?""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Eleanor Finch, ""Miss Finch," I say, my voice carrying just enough concern to be heard over the crackling fire, "Perhaps you would be best served by remaining here, in the company of those who care for your wellbeing. The chill of the storm, and indeed… the prevailing atmosphere, may not be conducive to… *recovery*. Are you quite certain you wish to venture out alone?""


Director:
 'Soaked Handkerchief' (described as: A white handkerchief, sodden with water, lying near the overturned armchair. It has a faint smell of almonds., state: damp) appears in Study.


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Thomas Dubois, ""My silence, Mr. Dubois, is not a sign of guilt, but of discretion. I am under no obligation to answer your insinuations. I suggest you direct your attention towards more relevant matters, before you find yourself... unwelcome.""

Director:
 'Note' (described as: A small, hastily scribbled note, torn in half, with a few words visible: "...meet...gallery...tonight...", state: torn) appears in Study.


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Eleanor Finch, ""Miss Finch, I say, my voice calm but firm, I understand your desire for fresh air, but I must strongly advise against it. The storm outside is treacherous, and the circumstances within... well, they require our immediate attention. Before you leave, perhaps you could answer a simple question. Do you know the nature of the oil present near the Study door, and whether you saw the silver tray before the incident?""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois, while I appreciate your... *persistence*, Miss Finch is clearly distressed. Pressing her with questions now would be, in my professional opinion, quite insensitive. Let us, at least, allow her to gather her composure. Perhaps, *after* a period of… reflection, she may be more inclined to answer your inquiries. Unless, of course," I add, my gaze flickering towards Mr. Davies and then back to Eleanor, "you believe her to be... *hiding* something. In which""


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Eleanor Finch, ""My dear Miss Finch," I say, my tone silky smooth, "The oppressive atmosphere, you say? Perhaps a breath of *fresh air* would be lovely, indeed.

Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Aris Thorne, ""Mr. Thorne, Your observations are astute, as always. However, rather than speculate on Miss Finch's potential reticence, perhaps you could enlighten us on the nature of your *professional* opinion. Specifically, Mr. Thorne, what *exactly* do you do, and what would be the professional benefit of preventing Miss Finch from being questioned""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies  : ""The questions regarding the oil, and the events in the Study, will be answered in due course. For now, I suggest we maintain a degree of… decorum. The Inspector’s arrival is imminent.”"

Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova  : ""Oh, but isn't it fascinating? The path to *Lord Alistair's final moments* is so… *clearly marked*. Footprints leading from the scene of… *tragedy*! The oil, the blood, the… *untold stories*… They simply *whisper* for us to unravel them. And what, pray tell, is the *meaning* of these""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Mr. Davies, ""I slowly turn my head towards Mr. Davies, a hint of a smile playing on my lips. "The Inspector's arrival, you say, Mr. Davies? How *convenient*. One might almost think the authorities were... *expected*. Perhaps Lord Alistair's passing was not quite as unexpected as it initially appeared, wouldn't you agree?" I allow my gaze to linger on Mr. Davies, gauging his reaction before adding, "Or perhaps you simply wished to expedite matters? To… control the narrative, as it were."""


Eleanor Finch's turn in Guest Bedroom:

Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies  : ""The Inspector’s arrival is indeed imminent. I trust you will all comport yourselves accordingly. Further speculation, at this juncture, is… *unwise*. I suggest you conserve your… *energies*.”"


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova  : ""I slowly turn my gaze towards the partially obscured oil stain on the floor, drawing a gloved hand towards my cheek in a gesture of thoughtful contemplation. \"Oil, of course,\" I murmur, my voice a low, theatrical whisper that carries across the room. \"Such a… *messy* substance. And its presence near the Study... most intriguing, wouldn't you say? One wonders, does it have any connection to the *subject* of our final discussion with Lord Alistair, specifically the *source* of his financial outlay? The painting's composition, its… *handling* of the pigments…” I trail""

Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Xenia Petrova, ""Madam Petrova," I say, my voice as steady as the ticking clock, "Your speculations are, as always, *theatrical*. However, they serve only to distract from the matter at hand. Lord Alistair is dead. The details of his demise will be revealed in due course.

And I, of course, share the same sentiments. Please, allow me to at least escort you to the guest bedroom. It is closest, should you need… anything at all. Or, if you would prefer, I could call for a servant to accompany you.""


Director:

Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Mr. Davies, ""My dear Mr. Davies, *respect* for the dead is certainly paramount, *particularly* when dealing with valuable assets. But perhaps you misunderstand. My 'performances' – as you so delicately put it – are merely an attempt to understand. And I, for one, find""

Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:

Director:
 'Bloodied Kitchen Knife' (described as: The bloodied kitchen knife is lying near the overturned armchair., state: bloodied) appears in Study.


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Mr. Davies, ""Indeed, Mr. Davies, it's *always* about the assets, isn't it? Perhaps the esteemed Inspector, when he arrives, might be *particularly* interested in the whereabouts of a certain *'Madonna of Shadows'*. I believe it was the subject of our *last* negotiation, wouldn't you say? Its value is... *significant*, wouldn't""


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Davies, while I appreciate your attempts to redirect the focus, the financial aspects of Lord Alistair's life are *absolutely* relevant. A potential motive, a missing asset... these are crucial considerations.

 Thomas Dubois to Aris Thorne, ""My interest stems from a simple pursuit of the truth, Mr. Thorne. A dead man, a potential financial dispute, and a painting of significant value... these are the elements of a potential crime. As for my interactions with Lord Alistair, they were limited to the polite formalities of a dinner guest. Now, if you'll indulge me, let's return to the matter at hand: the painting, and any potential disagreements regarding it. Did anyone here know of any such disputes, and if so, with whom?""

 Eleanor Finch reaches into the velvet pouch, pulls out a rolled-up piece of parchment, and slowly uncurls it, leaning in to read it. Because Eleanor Finch is curious about the contents of the velvet pouch.


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Davies, your repeated refusals to cooperate are, shall we say, *unhelpful*. While I understand your desire to await the official investigation, the immediacy of the situation demands a more proactive approach. The presence of oil, blood, and a potential financial motive strongly suggests a carefully planned event. I suggest, then, that *everyone* refrains from touching any further objects within this room, and remain where they are. The Inspector will want to""

 Xenia Petrova to Aris Thorne, ""Almonds, Mr. Thorne? That's an… *intriguing* observation. Tell me, is that a common ingredient in the… *perfumes* favored by those who frequent the study? Or perhaps, are you suggesting the oil's composition is more… *cul""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Xenia Petrova, ""Madam Petrova, the composition of the oil is, indeed, of some interest. But before we explore that further, let us consider the presence of... *blood*. I believe we have all, perhaps, overlooked a rather crucial detail. *Who* among us knew of Lord Alistair's... *allergy* to almonds?""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Aris Thorne, ""Mr. Thorne, your questions are becoming... *unsettling*. I find your constant probing of Lord Alistair's… *afflictions* quite distasteful. Perhaps you should focus on the more immediate concerns, such as the *manner* of his passing, rather than delving into... *senseless* details.""


Xenia Petrova's turn in Drawing Room:
 Xenia Petrova to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Davies, are you suggesting that Lord Alistair's allergy was a *secret*? A secret perhaps known only to those privy to his… *private* life? Or, perhaps, a secret known only to those who… *benefited* from his demise?""

 Aris Thorne to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois, the scent of the oil is quite distinct. As I mentioned, linseed oil and a hint of almonds, which, as you rightly point out, *could* be found in both a study and a kitchen.

 Eleanor Finch opens the wardrobe. Because Eleanor Finch wants to search the wardrobe for a bag.

Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Davies, you appear to be taking a particular interest in the fireplace. May I ask if you noticed anything unusual about its operation this evening? Did you, perhaps, see anyone near the fireplace, perhaps attending to it, before Lord Alistair was discovered?""


Eleanor Finch's turn in Guest Bedroom:
 Eleanor Finch pulls down the worn leather satchel from the shelf, opens it, and examines the interior. Because Eleanor Finch needs a discreet container for the parchment and assesses the satchel's suitability.

Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Thomas Dubois, ""The fire is certainly roaring tonight, isn't it? Such a stark contrast to the… *chill* in the air, both inside and out. I do hope someone remembered to inform the staff about keeping the flames contained; a fire in such a grand old house would be a catastrophe.""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies  : ""The hour is late. Let us all await the Inspector's arrival in *silence*.""


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Thorne, you mentioned almonds and a possible connection to the kitchen. Considering the oily footprint leading from the kitchen towards this room, and the bloodied handprint on the Study doorframe, I believe it prudent to secure the kitchen immediately. Mr. Davies, I must insist that you instruct the staff to seal the kitchen off. No one is to enter or leave until the official investigation commences, and the Inspector arrives. I would suggest that any kitchen staff remain""

The Inspector will decide, and until he arrives, *this house* will remain under my command."""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois, your insistence on securing the kitchen is... *intriguing*. I am certain the staff are devastated by Lord Alistair's passing, and the thought of them being unfairly accused is quite… *unsettling*. But perhaps," I pause, my gaze drifting towards Mr. Davies, "perhaps *someone* within this house is keen on controlling the narrative. I would hate to see the innocent... *punished*.""


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Aris Thorne, ""Mr. Thorne, you seem concerned about the potential innocence of the staff and the 'narrative'. Given that you have so readily identified the scent of the oil as linseed, and, considering Lord Alistair's known allergy, could you perhaps enlighten us as to your knowledge of the contents of Lord Alistair's Study, or indeed, his Kitchen? Does either room hold any significance to you, and, if so, why?""


Xenia Petrova's turn in Study:
 Xenia Petrova opens her handbag and retrieves a silver compact. Because Xenia Petrova wants to check her appearance.


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois," I reply, my voice laced with mock innocence, "are you suggesting *I* possess knowledge that might... *incriminate* me? How very… *preposterous*. While I am Lord Alistair's physician, my duties are solely medical. My familiarity with his, or indeed, the *kitchen's* contents, stems from no nefarious intent, but rather, a long-standing professional relationship. However, now that you mention it, I do believe there may be some almond oil stored away""


Eleanor Finch's turn in Guest Bedroom:
 Eleanor Finch closes and latches the window. Because Eleanor Finch is trying to protect herself from the storm.


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:
 Thomas Dubois to Mr. Davies, ""Mr. Davies, is it common practice for the staff to use linseed oil in the vicinity of the fireplace, or perhaps in any rooms frequented by Lord Alistair, who, as we know, suffered from a severe nut allergy? Your adamant refusal to secure the kitchen, coupled with your insistence on controlling the narrative, raises further questions in my mind. Perhaps you could elaborate on your reasons for this resistance. Your reticence suggests that you might be concealing information that could""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois, your *accusations* are as *unfounded* as they are *offensive*. The kitchen will remain under *my* supervision, as *this entire house* does. And I will *not* answer any more of your impertinent *questions* until the Inspector arrives.""


Xenia Petrova's turn in Study:

 Xenia Petrova carefully examines the loose thread, places it in an evidence bag, and seals it. Because Xenia Petrova is investigating the crime scene and collecting evidence.


Thomas Dubois's turn in Drawing Room:

The truth, I believe, is often found not in what is said, but in what is *left unsaid*, and the details we choose to *ignore*. Perhaps, in the face of such a tragedy, it is we all pause, and reflect""


Eleanor Finch's turn in Drawing Room:
 Eleanor Finch takes a tentative step towards the drawing-room door and listens intently. Because Eleanor Finch wants to leave the Guest Bedroom.


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Eleanor Finch, ""Eleanor, dear, are you quite alright? The storm outside seems to have matched the tumultuous events within. Perhaps you should sit down and allow me to fetch you some restorative tea. It might help steady your nerves.""


Thomas Dubois's turn in Study:
 Thomas Dubois slowly walks towards the door to the Study, pausing at the edge of the oil stain. Because Thomas Dubois wants to examine the handprint.


Eleanor Finch's turn in Drawing Room:
 Eleanor Finch to Aris Thorne, ""Thank you, Aris, but I... I don't think I can. The storm, and... everything... is rather overwhelming. Perhaps I might just… retire to my room. If you'll excuse me.""


Aris Thorne's turn in Drawing Room:
 Aris Thorne to Eleanor Finch, ""Eleanor, please, before you go, there is something I must ask you. Were you, by any chance, in Lord Alistair's study this evening? I only ask because... well, it may be important to clear up any misunderstandings, and I wouldn't want you to… *misinterpret* Mr. Dubois's inquiries. It is best to be forthright and honest, you know. It alleviates any suspicion.""


Xenia Petrova's turn in Study:
 Xenia Petrova to Thomas Dubois, ""Mr. Dubois," I say, my voice smooth and filled with a hint of amusement, "perhaps you can enlighten me. Is it considered… *impolite* to inquire about the finer details of Lord Alistair’s… *business affairs* in the midst of such a… *spectacle*? Or is that, perhaps, a question best left unanswered until the *Inspector* arrives?""


Mr. Davies's turn in Drawing Room:
 Mr. Davies to Eleanor Finch, ""Miss Finch, before you retire, perhaps you could enlighten us as to your whereabouts earlier this evening? It would be prudent to account for everyone's movements, wouldn't you agree?""
